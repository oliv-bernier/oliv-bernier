# Hi there, my name is Olivier 👋
## I'm a Web Developer with experience in TypeScript and Node.js, based in Rennes, North West of France  🌊🏙️

💻 I am currently working at VYTRUVE since July, 2021 with **React** and **NestJS** as the main stack.

⚡ Started web development with PHP, fell in love with JavaScript, and now code with **TypeScript**.

🔭 I plan to learn new languages and libraries and would like to continue sharing some fun side projects here so feel free to follow!

👋 Hope to meet you.
