# Hi there, my name is Olivier 👋
## I'm a Web Developer with experience in JavaScript, React but also PHP, based in Rennes, North West of France 🌊🏙️

💻 I’m currently working on a project of web application using React and Redux technologies. I use Agile methodology with SCRUM, and are part of a four web-developers team including Symfony developers for the Back-End.

☝️ I have a real taste for the Front-End part but I also know how to code PHP with object-oriented programming and an MVC architecture, as well as build or improve a database.

👀 Take a look at my portfolio : https://www.obernier.fr

👋 Hope to meet you.
