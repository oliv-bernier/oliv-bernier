### Hi there 👋

## I'm a Web Developer with experience in JavaScript, React but also PHP.

🔭 I’m currently working on a project of web application using React and Redux technologies. On this project I use Agile methodology with SCRUM.

☝️ I have a real taste for the Front-End part but I also know how to code PHP with an MVC architecture and object-oriented programming, as well as build or improve a database.

👀 Take a look at my portfolio : https://www.obernier.fr
