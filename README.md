# Hi there, my name is Olivier 👋
## I'm a Web Developer with experience in JavaScript and PHP, based in Rennes, North West of France 🌊🏙️

💻 I’m using React and Vue.js to build Single Page Applications. I can also run stores like Redux or Vuex. 

☝️ I have a real taste for the Front-End part but I also know how to code Node.js or PHP with object-oriented programming and an MVC architecture, as well as build or improve a database.

👀 Take a look at my portfolio : https://www.obernier.fr

👋 Hope to meet you.
